Why my Design is Better?
I have tried to accomodate the following principles:

Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) Principle
Keep It Simple and Stupid (KISS) Principle
The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
The Open/Closed Principle
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
The Composition Over Inheritance Principle

Moreover SOLID principles are stricly followed and use of enum instead of using some magic numbers.
